## MPG vs wt, cyl, and hp

Size of plot points below are relative to horsepower (larger point = higher horsepower). Color legend is for cylinders.

```{r graph}
data(mtcars)

x <- list(
  title = "Weight (1000 lbs)"
)
y <- list(
  title = "Miles/(US) gallon (MPG)"
)
fig <- plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, color = ~factor(cyl), size = ~hp, type = "scatter")
fig <- fig %>% layout(xaxis = x, yaxis = y)

fig
```

## The End

### Thanks!
